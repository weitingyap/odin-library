# Odin Library

This is a simple client-side web app to manage books in a library. The user can add new books. For existing books, the user can toggle read status or delete them.

## Tech used

**Tech Used:** HTML, CSS, Javascript, Git

In particular, I practiced:
* HTML dialogs
* HTML forms
* HTML tables
* CSS styling, custom properties
* CSS flexbox
* Javascript DOM manipulation
* Javascript event handling
* Javascript form dialog data handling
* JavaScript object constructors, ES6 classes
* Git branching for separate features

## Lessons 

* How to use an HTML dialog and manage its default behavior
* How to add responsive styling for user interaction (e.g. shadow when a user clicks an input)

## Opportunites for further iteration

* Use a backend/SQL database instead of storing books in client-side
* Do not rely on each book's order of properties to populate the table, in case of missing or corrupted values
* Refactoring for abstraction: functions to manage books in the library array vs functions to display books in the front end can be separated for better readability
